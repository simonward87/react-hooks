This is a small personal collection of custom React hooks. I've tried to make
the functionality as clear as possible by commenting each hook throughout.
Decided to make them public as I felt they may be useful for others with the
same problems to solve.

| The React library is not included â€” it is assumed that these hooks are added
to a project that is already using react. |
